# Subway-Surfers-Motion-Controlled

I developed Subway Surfers Motion Controlled using the Mediapie and Movente libraries, which enables you to play the popular game Subway Surfers using your webcam as a controller. This project leverages a range of cutting-edge algorithms to ensure swift and precise motion detection. It was initially designed for presentation at the NIIMACK Cultural Fest hosted by IIIT Bhopal. Here's a rephrased and more detailed description that you can post on GitHub:

Subway Surfers Motion Controlled is an innovative project that offers a unique way to experience the popular mobile game Subway Surfers. Instead of using traditional input devices like a keyboard or touchscreen, this project utilizes your webcam as a motion controller. Developed using the Mediapie and Movente libraries, this system employs a sophisticated set of algorithms to ensure rapid and accurate motion detection.

Key Features:
- **Webcam-based Control**: Play Subway Surfers by moving your body and gestures in front of your webcam. It adds a fun and interactive dimension to the game.

- **Fast Processing**: The project incorporates state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure that motion detection is not only accurate but also lightning-fast. This enhances the responsiveness of your in-game movements, providing a seamless gaming experience.

- **IIIT Bhopal's NIIMACK Cultural Fest**: Subway Surfers Motion Controlled was originally created as part of a presentation for IIIT Bhopal's Cultural Fest, NIIMACK. It was a highlight of the event, demonstrating the intersection of technology and entertainment.

By sharing this project on GitHub, we aim to make this motion-controlled version of Subway Surfers accessible to a wider audience, fostering creativity and exploration at the intersection of gaming and technology. Enjoy a novel way to play Subway Surfers and explore the code to understand the intricacies of motion-controlled gaming. Join us in the world of innovative game development!
